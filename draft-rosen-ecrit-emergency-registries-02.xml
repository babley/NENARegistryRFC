    <abstract>
      <t>Multiple emergency services standards organizations are developing specifications based on IETF emergency calling and other IETF protocols. There is a desire among these organizations to use common registries, not tied to a particular country or national Standards Development Organization (SDO), in the long term pursuit of a single worldwide standard. This document asks IANA to create a set of registries and provides processes for expanding the set and populating them.</t>

        <xref target="RFC6443" />
        establishes a framework for carrying emergency calls over the Internet using the SIP (

        <xref target="RFC3261" />
        ) protocol.  Various regional organizations are developing standards for how calls conforming to this framework are handled within the Emergency Services IP Networks (ESInets) established by local, regional or national authorities to handle such calls and deliver them to the appropriate Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP). Many of these standards have needed registries of values used in the protocols and services the services define.  Prior to this document, such registries were managed by the regional SDOs themselves.  There is a desire among many of the regional emergency services SDOs to have a single worldwide standard for handling emergency calls, and as part of that effort, a single set of registries managed by a neutral party.  This document requests IANA to establish a new top-level registry called "Emergency" and to create a set of sub-registries within that registry. This document does not provide initial contents of the registries, with some exceptions. The registries will be populated by requests from the regional SDOs, including <xref target="NENAi3" format="default">The NENA i3 Standard</xref>.

        <name>"Emergency" Group</name>
        <t>
          IANA is requested to establish the registries within this section under the "Emergency" group. These registries contain enumerated values used for various aspects of emergency calling and call handling.  New registries or subregistries in the "Emergency" group require a standards document, which MAY be a standards track RFC, but also MAY be a defined in a document from a recognized standards organization in which emergency services standards are in scope.  Where a new registry or subregistry is defined in an external standards organization, an expert SHALL review the document to ascertain that it is relevant to the "Emergency" area, that the organization defining the registry is a recognized standards organization in which emergency services standards are in scope, that the document clearly articulates the management method for the regisry, which MUST be substantially similar to one or more of the management methods in <xref target="RFC8216" />, and if expert review is specified, that experts acceptable to the IESG for the registry are available.  The expert(s) reviewing the new registry shall also request IANA to review the relevant documents using the same criteria as it would for a standards track RFC.  The expert SHALL NOT approve the new registry unless IANA is satisfied it can maintain the registry with the same or similar level of effort it expends for similar registries created by RFCs. If the management of the registry is specified as First Come First Served, which, per RFC8126 does not require an expert, an expert acceptable to the IESG must be available to answer questions about registrations and advise IANA of any issues in registrations in that registry.
        </t>
        <t>
          These registries are needed in order to implement <xref target="NENAi3">the NENA i3 Standard for Next-Generation 9-1-1</xref> as well as the <xref target="EIDO">NENA Standard for Emergency Incident Data Object</xref>. These standards, unless otherwise specified, will initially populate the registries created by this document. Some registries previously existed in <xref target="NRS" format="default">the NENA Registry System</xref>, but the intent of international SDOs is to maintain next-generation emergency calling registries under IANA in the future. <xref target="NRS" /> will be maintained only for backwards compatibility, and for registries required only for North America.

          <name>Purpose</name>
          <t>
            This namespace is used for unique identifiers for use in emergency services, including emergency calls. Although most uses for these identifiers will be within private "Emergency Services IP Networks" (ESInets), some use in the public Internet is expected. These identifiers will be used in several countries, and hopefully, eventually, worldwide for handling of emergency calls and incidents.  Prior to this document, North American emergency services used the "nena" Namespace Identifier (NID), defined in <xref target="RFC6061"/>.  Most identifiers in top level class &lt;&lt;urn:nena&gt;&gt; will be replaced by identifiers in &lt;&lt;urn:emergency&gt;&gt; in pursuit of a single worldwide standard set for emergency services which are not controlled by a single public safety organization like NENA. Identifiers with this NID do not require resolution. Identifiers in this NID will be primarily specified in public safety standards SDOs, but some IETF standards may use or define them.
          </t>
        </section>
        <section>
          <name>Syntax</name>
          <t>The basic syntax for identifiers in the emergency NID is:</t>
          <t>urn:emergency:&lt;top level class&gt;:&lt;extended&gt;</t>
          <t>where</t>
          <t>
            &lt;top level class&gt; is a member of the urn:emergency namespace registry, see <xref target="urnEmergency"/>
          </t>
          <t>&lt;extended&gt; is a class-specific value defined by the document describing the registry entry.  In many cases, the extension includes sub classes.  For example: urn:emergency:service:responder:police.local</t>
          <t>There are no special encoding rules for identifiers in urn:emergency.  URN equivalence is case insensitive. Hyphens are not expected in these identifiers, but if used, they are significant in comparisons.  Quotes are not allowed in this NID.  There are no special considerations for conforming to URN syntax.  Percent encoding is permitted.  There are no uses for q-components or f-components in this namespace.</t>
        </section>
        <section>
          <name>Assignment</name>
          <t>
            Assignment of top level classes is by standards documents, both standards-track RFCs and standards documents in other SDOs.  See <xref target="urnEmergency"/>.  Assignments within top level classes are as specified in the document that defines the class. Such documents MUST specify how uniqueness within the class is achieved.
          </t>
        </section>
        <section>
          <name>Security and Privacy</name>
          <t>The document defining a top level class MUST describe the security and privacy considerations of that class.  In general, there are no special security considerations for these identifiers.  Several top level classes are defined in this document.  In some circumstances, these identifiers may indicate what kind of agency is involved with a public safety incident, and some may identify a specific agency.  Transport encryption of the communications that contain the identifier in classes defined in this document is REQUIRED and MUST be TLS or an equally secure protocol. Specifications implementing classes in this document MAY allow exceptions to this encryption requirement if justified. Where a document defines top level class(es), it MUST state if transport encryption is required when conveying any indentifiers it defines.</t>
        </section>
        <section>
          <name>Interoperability</name>
          <t>Many of the identifiers in &lt;urn:emergency&gt; are similar in construction and use to identifiers originally defined in urn:nena. Backwards compatibility with those identifiers MUST be specified in the documents that use them. NENA STA-010.3-2021 is the document that defined and uses most of the identifiers in "&lt;urn:nena&gt;"; a future revision is expected to address backwards compatibility requirements between "&lt;urn:emergency&gt;" and "&lt;urn:nena&gt;". There are no other interoperability issues.</t>
        </section>
        <section>

          <t>
            In most cases, top level classes of urn:emergency will define subregistries.  Several levels of subregistries may be needed. The document that defines the class MUST define the subregistry if needed. IETF and emergency service standards organizations MAY define subregistries of &lt;&lt;urn:emergency&gt;&gt;. Instructions to IANA for the subregistry MUST conform to <xref target="RFC8126"/>.  The expert reviewer for the top level class works with IANA to assure that they do if the standards organization creating the subregistry is not the IETF.

            <t>
              When calls are routed to or within an Emergency Services IP Network (ESInet), the routing element queries a LoST <xref target="RFC5222"/> server for the (nominal) route. It does so with a service URN. External routing is accomplished with "urn:service:sos", as defined by <xref target="RFC5031"/>. Within an ESInet, values under this registry are used.
            </t>
            <t>Service URNs as defined here begin with “urn:emergency:service”. The sub-namespace defined by this registry MAY be further subdivided (potentially several times), by sub-registries under this sub-registry. The separator between urn:emergency:service and the entry in the subregistry is a colon (":"). A new entry starting with “urn:emergency:service” SHOULD denote a new type of route, which MUST be distinguished by the LoST server from other uses. For example, emergency calls being routed to or within the ESInet use “urn:emergency:service:sos” (or a subspace of it). Calls routed by a PSAP to a responder use “urn:emergency:service:responder” (the type of responder is also included, e.g.,  “urn:emergency:service:responder.police”). A client specifies the URN in a LoST query, and the LoST Server uses it to choose a (nominal) route.</t>

            <t>Routing of emergency calls within the ESInet is a primary function of systems that process such calls. When routing entities must route calls within the ESInet, they query the LoST Server for the route. Routing for emergency calls may involve multiple levels of routing entities. Each level may need a different URN to be distinguishable. Routing of emergency calls, including instant messages and non-interactive calls within an ESInet, is accomplished with a URN beginning with “urn:emergency:service:sos”.  The “urn:emergency:service:sos” registry contains values appropriate for the various levels of routing within the ESInet.

            <t>IANA is requested to creates a subregistry for "urn:emergency:service:test" under "urn:emergency:service".</t>
            <t>Test calls are directed to “urn:service:test.sos”. To route such test calls where the routing infrastructure uses multiple levels of routing, and thus uses URNs in the “urn:emergency:service:sos” registry, service URNs are needed for test calls with corresponding levels. IANA is requested to create an entry in the “urn:emergency:service” registry with the name “test” and with the purpose noted as “routing test calls within the ESInet toward a primary PSAP”. The reference will be to the registry created by this section, “urn:emergency:service:test”. The separator between the “test” label and the service (“urn:emergency:service:test” registry entry) is a period “.”. The “urn:emergency:service:test” registry contains label values corresponding to the levels in the “urn:emergency:service:sos” registry. These registries are normally kept in sync, an entry added to “urn:emergency:service:sos” should also add a corresponding entry to urn:emergency:service:test.</t>

            <t>IANA is requested to create the "urn:emergency:service:responder" subregistry under "urn:emergency:service"</t>
            <t>Once a PSAP gets a call, they may have to transfer the call to a secondary PSAP. The secondary PSAP is chosen based on the type of responder, and the location of the caller. Routing of emergency calls from a PSAP towards a responder is accomplished with a URN beginning with “urn:emergency:service:responder”. IANA is requested to create an entry in the “urn:emergency:service” registry with the name “responder” and with the purpose noted as “routing emergency calls within the ESInet towards a responder”. The reference will be to the registry created by this section, “urn:emergency:service:responder”.</t>
            <t>The “urn:emergency:service:responder” registry contains label values appropriate for the types of responders within the ESInet. The separator between the “responder” label and the type of responder (“urn:emergency:service:responder” registry value) is a period “.”. This registry is also used in other contexts where an agency type is useful. For those purposes, a 'psap' entry is provided. “urn:emergency:service:responder.psap” must not be used to route emergency calls. It is not equivalent to, or a substitute for “urn:service:sos” or "urn:emergency:service:sos".</t>
            <t>Some of the entries in this registry will require further subdivision.  Subregistries for such divisions are REQUIRED.</t>

              Agencies connected to an ESInet need to connect to various services and public safety agencies. A service called the Service/Agency Locator provides a directory ("white pages") of agencies, together with key information about the service or agency. The Service/Agency Locator is a distributed database. There are several mechanisms by which the Service/Agency Locator can be searched to locate a specific service or agency. When searching for a service by location, the LoST protocol (<xref target="RFC5222"/> is used, which accepts a URN that specifies the service being searched by location. This registry provides URNS to be used in a LoST query to find a specific service at a particular location.

              SIP Media Feature tags as defined in <xref target="RFC3840"/> are used to indicate user agent capabilities. SIP elements inside ESInets use this mechanism to indicate availablity of certain emergency call specific functionality.

            A variety of services are used during the processing of emergency calls. These services are deployed within an ESInet and are discoverable using the LoST [RFC5222] protocol or a discovery service known as the Service/Agency Locator (SAL). Standardized query terms are needed for both discovery mechanisms to work. When querying LoST, the service URNs in section 4.4.5.1. "urn:emergency:service" Subregistry are used. When querying the SAL, service names from the registry defined in this section are used. IANA is requested to create the ServiceNames subregistry in

            When using the LoST protocol <xref target="RFC5222"/> to validate a location prior to using it in an emergency call, a match against a civic address record in the LoST server may not be the most specific record intended by the Location Information Server.  This arises because authorities may not have incomplete records.  The emergency standards define an extension to LoST that returns the type of record that matched the location information in the LoST request.  This registry enumerates the match types that can be returned.

          <t>Errors and discrepancies may occur in any set of data, including databases, configurations, etc. Standardized Discrepancy Report (DR) functions allow reporting and responding to reports of discrepancies across vendors.

This registry enumerates the tokens, and where they can be used.</t>
          <t>The registry contains the name of the element in the DR object that uses the token, and the DR type that uses that element.  More than one element could use the same token, and more than one DR type could use the same element name (and token values).  This means registration requests can specify more than one value in the "Name" and "DiscrepancyReports" columns, and a new registration can add a value to "Name" or "Discrepancy Report" for an existing entry.</t>

          <name>"EIDO-IncidentType-Common" Registry</name>
          <t>
            When multiple agencies are involved in an incident, the type of incident must be communicated clearly.  Many agencies have internal incident typing systems that are incompatible with each other.  The Association of Public Safety Communications Offials (APCO) has documented a set of incident types which are the original basis for this registry (<xref target="APCO" />), but there is no registry of codes. This registry forms the complete listing of common type codes.

          <t>
            An agency assigns a disposition to an incident when its participation in the incident ends. The disposition code indicates whether follow-up reports are required and conveys other information about the incident, such as whether it resulted from a false or actual alarm. They are used to exchange the status and follow up requirements of an incident upon its closure. The disposition codes are drawn from a registry containing common disposition codes for Police, Fire and EMS disciplines. These codes are defined by <xref target="APCO1.111" /> and implemented by <xref target ="EIDO" />.
          </t>
          <t>APCO ANS 1.111.2-2018 uses a two-digit integer as an incident status code. IANA is also requested to hold values 46-100 for future versions of the standard.</t>
